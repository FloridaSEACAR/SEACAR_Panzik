# Indicator Summary Text Generated by SQL Stored Procedures

The SQL scripts in this folder are used to generate and update "State of the Indicator" text for indicators with fairly simple logic.

Summary text generation is kicked off when [usp_analysis_final_ins] calls [usp_analysis_trends_update] which calls indicator specific procedures.

NOTE: it is important to update [usp_analysis_trends_python_update] with output from "analysisIndicatorSummaries.py".
