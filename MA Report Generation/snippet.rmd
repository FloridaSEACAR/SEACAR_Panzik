# Threshold Filtering

Threshold filters, following Florida Department of Environmental Protection Division of Environmental Assessment and Restoration (DEAR) are used to exclude specific results values from the SEACAR Analysis. Based on the threshold filters, QAQC Flags are inserted into the SEACAR_QAQCFlagCode and SEACAR_QAQC_Description columns of the export data. The Include_YN column indicates whether the QAQC Flag will also indicate that data are excluded from analysis. No data are excluded from the data export, but the analysis scripts can use the Include_YN column to exclude data.

# Value Qualifiers

Value qualifier codes included within the data are used to exclude certain results from the analysis. The data are retained in the data export files, but the analysis uses the "Include" column to filter the results.

**STORET and WIN value qualifier codes**

Value qualifier codes from STORET and WIN data are examined with the database and used to populate the Include_YN column in data exports.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
vq_df <- data.frame(vq = c("H","J","V","Y"),
                    inc = c(0, 0, 0, 0), 
                    mdl = c(0, 0, 0, 0),
                    qual_soruce = c("STORET-WIN", "STORET-WIN", "STORET-WIN", "STORET-WIN"))
kable(vq_df, col.names = c("*Value Qualifier*", "*Include YN*", "*MDL YN*", "*Qualifier Source*"),
      escape = F, 
      caption = "Value Qualifier codes excluded from analysis",
      format = "simple") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down",
                position = "center")
```

**Systemwide Monitoring Program (SWMP) value qualifier codes**

Value qualifier codes from the SWMP continuous program are examined with the database and used to populate the Include_YN column in data exports. SWMP Qualifier Codes are indicated by QualifierSource=SWMP.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
swmp <- data.frame(qs = c("SWMP", "SWMP", "SWMP", "SWMP", "SWMP", "SWMP", "SWMP", "SWMP", "SWMP", "SWMP", "SWMP"),
                   vq = c(-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
                   inc = c(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1),
                   desc = c("Optional parameter not collected","Missing data","Data rejected due to QA/QC","Outside low sensor range",
                            "Outside high sensor range","Passed initial QA/QC checks","Suspect data","Reserved for future use",
                            "Calculated data: non-vented depth/level sensor correction for changes in barometric pressure",
                            "Historical: Pre-auto QA/QC","Corrected data"))
swmp$desc <- linebreak(swmp$desc)

swmp %>% kable(col.names = c("*Qualifier Source*", "*ValueQualifier*", "*Include YN*", "*Description*"),
      escape = F, 
      caption = "SWMP Value Qualifier codes",
      format = "simple") %>%
  column_spec(4, width = "20em") %>% 
  kable_styling(#latex_options = c("scale_down","HOLD_position"),
                position = "center")
```
